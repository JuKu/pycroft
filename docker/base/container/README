Entrypoint Commands
===================

The entrypoint script searches for commands in the /container/commands directory.
To add a command to the entrypoint script, simply place a source-able bash
script with the name of the command in this folder.

The script should provide two functions: `usage` and `run`.

`usage` should print a usage message to stdout.

`run` should run the command.

Entrypoint Hooks
================

Place executable files following the rules of run-parts(8) into subdirectories
to let the entrypoint script automatically execute them.

The following exist currently:

init: Executed very early.

before-command: Executed before a command is executed. Takes the name of the
command as first parameter
